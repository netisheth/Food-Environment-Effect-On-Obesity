# Food-Environment-Effect-On-Obesity

The obesity epidemic is affecting wealthy and poor countries alike. It's a complex and expensive health problem that needs to be tackled with collective effort. Everybody knows about human risk factors such as diet, physical activity, inactivity, drug use, and genetics. Many key factors in our society include education, skills, food marketing, affordability of healthy foods, physical activity, and food environment. 

The food environment plays a major and frequently dominant role in nutrition choice, eating habits, and eventually energy intake. Analyzed the impact of food environments on adult obesity rates to give the county officials some actionable insights.

Merged sociodemographic, restaurants, food stores, and obesity data from the Food Environment Atlas - United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the US Census American Community Survey for all the US counties in the year 2010. Used Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression to understand the cause and effect.
Results suggest that active lifestyle, healthier food environment and choices are significant in controlling obesity.
